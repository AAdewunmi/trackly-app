# 🎯 Trackly — Job Application Tracker

Trackly is a web-based application that helps job seekers track, manage, and analyze their job applications.

Built with Java, Spring Boot, and Thymeleaf, it provides a clean interface to log job applications,

manage stages like “Applied” or “Interviewing”, and visualize job search progress with charts and insights.

## 📌 Features (MVP)

- ✅ User Registration & Login (Spring Security)
- ✅ Add/Edit/Delete Job Applications
- ✅ Status Pipeline: Applied → Interviewing → Offer → Rejected
- ✅ Filter/Search by status, company, or role
- ✅ 📊 **Insights Dashboard** — View total applications, status breakdown, and weekly progress
- 🌓 Responsive UI with Dark Mode (optional)
- 🚀 Deployed to [Your Host] (e.g., Render, Railway, etc.)
